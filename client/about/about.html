			Fir Sure started out as a street art project in Portland, Oregon in 2014. Inspired by Oregon’s spirit of greenery, arts, and Douglas Fir trees, Fir Sure started a fun sticker for friends to share.

		<p class='about_text'>
			The idea quickly gained traction thanks to the pride and smiles it seemed to spread in people throughout the region, and naturally grew into a larger PNW-based community, movement, and lifestyle. Fir Sure encourages people to live their passions while staying mindful of their contribution to the planet. Live to feel good, and feel good about how you live!
